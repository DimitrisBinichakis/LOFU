# LOFU (Living off File Uploads)

### What is this project ?

 LOFU is a curated list of domains that can be used for file uploads. These are domains that can be abused by threat actors to either host malware or exfiltrate data. The list includes domains that allow uploading files of various sizes for different needs.

 ### What is the purpose of this project ?

  The idea is to use this list of domains to get an idea of when, how and what data has left your environment. While these sites can be used for legitimate purposes and hosting, they can also be abused by threat actors or insider threats. It is meant to be used as a good basis of a threat hunt hypothesis, to potentially identify data exfiltration by querying for requests towards these domains. You can use this to identify suspicious outbound traffic and analyze any relevant web traffic logs.

### How can I contribute to this list?

Obviously due to the nature of these sites, it is expected that they come and go, and new ones are spun up. The goal is to keep this project updated frequently. Feel free to open a pull request if you want to contribute with any domains of your own. You are also welcome to star this project since I enjoy imaginary internet points.
